# MySQL Burger
#### A restaurant application that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat!

## About 
This app utilizes GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes to log burgers into MySQL. 

When a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the lefthand side. A button appears with the new burger, inviting the user to "Devour" it. When the user clicks "Devour", the burger moves to the right side of the page. 

Each burger is stored in the database and reflects whether or not it has been eaten.

This application follows an MVC design pattern and is built with **MySQL**, **Node**, **Express**, **Handlebars** and a homemade **ORM**.
